  1. Discuss QIIME2 Processing
  - Evelyn will look at new trimming parameters if we email her the demux this weekend
  - Avril has uploaded new metadata good to go for data processing
  - Avril has ran first step so should work
  - Best to trim forward and reverse reads the same (if one is bad it is a limiting factor)
  - Mention geographical location as limitation in our study because sample_id's don't align so we couldn't include it
    
  2. Gantt Chart
  - Excel by default selects all of them -> use [Cmd] or [Ctrl] to individually select bars
    
  3. New Dataset Wrangling Section
  - Reiterate about splitting data by sex (mention how many samples are male and female)
  - Do not need a sub-dataset wrangling section
  - Otherwise section will be pretty short overall
    
  4. Plan actionables for next week/meeting
  - Data processed by next week
  - Create phyloseq objects (one for male, one for female) in R by next week (CJ/Theresa)
  - phyloseq object needs to be filtered in R but not retrimmed or denoised
  - do typical filtering removing chloroplast and mitochondrion stuff

  5. Future meetings timeline
  - Reading week meetings are optional (14th)
  - Could have alpha/beta diversity analyses done by the 14th
  - Have all the analyses (everything that's taxonomic) by the 21st
  - Aim to have functional done by end of November if needed

  6. Deadlines for the proposal
  - Final deadline: November 2nd 6PM
  - Submission deadline: November 2nd 11:59PM
  - Don't need to include data overview section, replaced by data wrangling section
