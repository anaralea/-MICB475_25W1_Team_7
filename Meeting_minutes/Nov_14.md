1. Phyloseq Code
  - Not rarefied yet
  - Does have a confidence column
  - One sample missing a space (code that into the generation of the phyloseq)
  - Evelyn fixed it and updated the phyloseq.R file
  
2. Next steps / Divide up tasks
  - Alpha & beta diversity (aim 1) - Joshua
    - first generate alpha rarefaction curve to figure out how to rarefy it
    - email the sampling depth to Evelyn before we run it
    - then do alpha/beta diversity (do all of them)
    - and do the stats to see if there's anything significant
    - all in R
  - Core microbiome & indicator taxa (aim 2) - CJ
  - Differential abundance analysis (aim 3) - Theresa
    - pairwise comparisons (3 groups + male/female, lots to run)
  - Functional analysis (aim 4) - Dependent on how the first three aims go
    - whole team will help out with this if we need to do this
  - Everyone will be hands on for analyzing data and results
  
3. Project Proposal Resubmission
  - look at comments and fix it
  - data wrangling section: give dataset background to give context
  - just email Evelyn if we need an extension
  - deadline for resubmission is Monday (Nov 17th)

4. Plan actionables for next week/meeting
  - Get some figures from the analyses for next meeting
  - present figures from each type of analyses
  - last step if we see interesting comparisons then we move forward with functional analysis
