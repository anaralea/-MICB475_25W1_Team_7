1. Updates/changes from last week
  - Core microbiome & indicator taxa (aim 2) - Clara
      - females are balanced, males changed
      - males are more unique to the controls, and only 5% shared
      - doesn't show up in alpha-beta diversity
      - indicator taxa, took out stat = 0.6 and took out unique to only one group, only 5
        
  - Differential abundance analysis (aim 3) - Theresa
      - Validated DESeq2 results
      - Reuploaded volcano and bar plots, updated R script as well
      - big taxonomic differences, cancelling out overall affects of diversity
      - bar plots only for the top 10 each, top 5 increase, top 5 decrease
      - maybe add a table: how many were overrepresented, underrepresented and the other ones (not significant)
      - increase the text size for everything for volcano plots
      - don't focus on unclassified for bar plots
      - contact Avril if we want to do a heat map but only if we have time and want to do it
      - incertae sedis (means unclassified) and unclassified
      - email avril link or code and he will add something to fix bar plots
      - make the colours consistent for the bar plots for the phyla
   
2. Discuss Functional Analysis
  - Will focus on doing metacyc analysis only
  - Where to find ggpicrust tutorial R file?
  - Which differential abundance analysis to run?
  - Should we generate a heatmap and PCA plot?
  - Should we do an enrichment analysis?

3. Discuss Presentation powerpoint
  - Different for male and female so good that we highlight
  - M and F don't share a lot of core microbes
  - title needs to be "sexier" (- Evelyn) -> more conclusive that encompasses everything
  - background looks good
  - outbreak of CWD in okanagan (recently) could use pictures from that and mention
  - don't need references and very text heavy in justification and background
  - justification split to research gap and impact
  - add a research gap slide: looking at severity which hasn't been done before
  - add a dataset slide (encorporate pathology states slide into that slide) (add a picture for the three pathology states)
  - where it was collected, how many samples, etc -> then these are the groups we studied (use same acronyms as figures)
  - 4 slides for intro is enough (background, impact, research gap, dataset study)
  - mention stratifying for sex when we talk about the dataset
  - research aims after dataset slide as transition
    
  - alpha beta diversity, pick one (maybe just observed) -> figure could be bigger -> title: no significance in alpha-beta diversity...
  - females on the top and males on bottom
  - the title should be the takeaway
  - unifracs slides -> beta diversity also did not show significance -> keep only the unweighted one
  - capturing only 5% total variance, not fully representative of the entire dataset which explains why we might be getting significance later on
    
  - core microbiome: two brief bullet points, females and males on one slide
  - title could be like: not many core microbes shared
    
  - differential abundance: keep only the br & ln vs control, and ln vs control, one slide females on top males on bottom
  - put numbers on the volcano plot to show how many are significant in each sector of volcano plot (magnitude changes)
  - add titles and subtitles
  - takeaway: is a lot of changes
    
  - main takeaway: seeing a lot of difference in the differential abundance but not the alpha diversity, could compare to paper
  - future directions

4. Discuss Group 8's presentation
  - When/who to reach out to to get primed on the machine learning aspect
  - Should touch base with each other once we receive the presentation on who will be presenting what part
    
5. Manuscript
  - alpha diversity (figure 1) 2 panels: A/B (female and male observed and shannon)
  - beta diversity (figure 2) four panels: A/B (unweighted/weighted for females), C/D (unweighted/weighted for males)
  - core microbiome (figure 3) two panels: A/B (female then male core microbiome)
  - indicator taxa (table 1): put males and females altogether
  - differential abundance (figure 4): Panel A/B/C all female volcano plots (LN v Control 1st, BR & LN v LN 2nd, BR & LN vs Control 3rd) same pattern for D/E/F (males)
  - G/H/I will be females but bar plots (same order as before), same thing for males J/K/L for males but bar plots
    - volcano plots show extent of the changes
    - bar plots show more specifics
  - picrus (figure 5) for manuscript but not for presentation
    
6. Plan actionables for next week/meeting
  - meeting next week have skeleton for paper
