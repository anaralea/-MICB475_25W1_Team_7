  - Changes to the focus of the project (farm comparison, or sex comparison?)
  - Changes to the aims
  - Sample SRR23559504 is missing the sex of that sample
  2. Discuss QIIME2 processing
  - Go over rough QIIME2 code
  - Troubleshooting difficulties
  3. Plan actionables for next week/meeting
  - Discuss schedules/availabilities for next week
  - Discuss potential to take on more beyond just QIIME2 processing and proposal
  4. Deadlines for the proposal

  1. Discuss research question
  - Draft: How do microbial communities vary across prion pathology states in white-tailed deer, and are these differences consistent between Farm 1 and Farm 2?
  2. Discuss aims of the project
  - Aim 0: Reproduce unweighted UniFrac PcoA plots to confirm previously reported differences between Farm 1 and Farm 2
  - Aim 1: Analyze alpha and beta diversity in deer gut microbiomes across pathology states in farm vs free-range environment
  - Aim 2: Identify core microbiome members and indicator taxa that are associated with pathology states
  - Aim 3: Perform differential abundance testing between pathology states within farms
  3. Discuss what approaches belong to which aims and what needs to be done for QIIME2 processing
  - Diversity (Alpha & Beta) analysis
  - Coremicrobiome Analysis
  - Indicator Taxa
  - Differential Abundance Analysis
  - Functional Analysis
  4. Divide the workload for the project proposal & discuss schedules/availability for next week
  5. Deadlines for proposal
  - Soft deadline: October 24th (next meeting)
  - Final deadline: October 26th 11:59PM
