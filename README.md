## November 7, 2025
### Agenda:
1. Discuss Qiime2 processing
- Metadata was modified based on Keemei feedback
  - sample_name column changed to samplename
- Which classifier to use for taxonomy?
- What kind of filtering needs to be done in Qiime2 (if any)?
  - Mitochondria and Chloroplast, frequency based, metadata based
- Are we doing Alpha rarefaction and diversity metrics in Qiime2?

  1. Discuss QIIME2 processing
  - Issues with artificial quality scores
  - Updates from Avril
  - Next steps
  2. Gantt Chart
  - How to get rid of blue bars and only keep orange?
  - How to select for certain bars only to change colours?
  3. New Dataset Wrangling Section
  - Go over what is on proposal so far
  - What else should be included? What level of detail?
  4. Plan actionables for next week/meeting
  - Discuss schedules/availabilities for next week

  1. Discuss new metadata
  - Changes to the focus of the project (farm comparison, or sex comparison?)
  - Changes to the aims - to review

  2. Discuss QIIME2 processing
  - Go over rough QIIME2 code
  - Troubleshooting difficulties
  3. Review draft timeline for Gantt chart
  - Check feasibility
  4. Plan actionables for next week/meeting
  - Discuss schedules/availabilities for next week
  - Discuss potential to take on more beyond just QIIME2 processing and proposal
  5. Deadlines for the proposal
  - Soft deadline: October 31st (next meeting)
  - Final deadline: November 2nd 11:59PM

### Agenda:
  [Link to Proposal Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7zjuJCClrZfTSDmK4jr_p3a6KggbvnTL8H-YwDolqA/edit?usp=sharing)
  1. Discuss research question
  - Draft: How do microbial communities vary across prion pathology states in white-tailed deer, and are these differences consistent between Farm 1 and Farm 2?
  2. Discuss aims of the project
  - Aim 0: Reproduce unweighted UniFrac PcoA plots to confirm previously reported differences between Farm 1 and Farm 2
  - Aim 1: Analyze alpha and beta diversity in deer gut microbiomes across pathology states in farm vs free-range environment
  - Aim 2: Identify core microbiome members and indicator taxa that are associated with pathology states
  - Aim 3: Perform differential abundance testing between pathology states within farms
  3. Discuss what approaches belong to which aims and what needs to be done for QIIME2 processing
  - Diversity (Alpha & Beta) analysis
  - Coremicrobiome Analysis
  - Indicator Taxa
  - Differential Abundance Analysis
  - Functional Analysis
  4. Divide the workload for the project proposal & discuss schedules/availability for next week
  5. Deadlines for proposal
  - Soft deadline: October 24th (next meeting)
  - Final deadline: October 26th 11:59PM
