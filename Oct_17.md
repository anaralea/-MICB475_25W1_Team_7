October 17 - Meeting minutes

Aims:

Aim 1: Reproduce unweighted UniFrac PcoA plots to confirm previously reported differences between Farm 1 and Farm 2.

Aim 2: Analyze alpha and beta diversity in deer gut microbiomes across pathology states in both farm groups.

Aim 3: Identify core microbiome members and indicator taxa that are associated with pathology states.

Aim 4: Perform differential abundance testing between pathology states within farms.

Aim 5: Perform Functional analysis of metabolic pathways between pathology states within farms.

Research Question:
- How do microbial communities vary across prion pathology states in white-tailed deer?
- Need to effectively communicate that the two farms are not being compared to each other, but just two cohorts

Data Processing:
- Begin QIIME2 processing this weekend
- Confirm trim length with Evelyn before running the next step
- Metadata file uploaded to server does not have pathology column
    - Needs to be fixed before processing and re-uploaded onto the server for visualisation in Qiime2 View
    - Can be fixed in R and merged using left_join
- Need to add Aim 1 plot into proposal

Introduction:
- Summarize previous paper
- Explain why our project is novel, hasn't been done on this dataset
- Summarize existing knowledge in microbiome prion research
